#REMOVE_ME_AFTER_EDITING
# Sample dev compose file. It can be helpful to provide this kind of file
# for samples where a user may want to hot reload changes in the app, or
# if it depends on stateful services like a database that isn't supported
# by Defang, like MongoDB.
#
# Note: This dev compose file's services should extend the production 
# compose file's services. That way we can keep things consistent across
# dev and production and override only what we need to.
