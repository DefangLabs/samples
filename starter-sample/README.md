This is a sample that shows the rough structure of an actual Defang sample. This top paragraph should give a bit of context about the project and what it does. The rest of the README should be a guide on how to use the sample. #REMOVE_ME_AFTER_EDITING

## Prerequisites

1. Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)
2. (Optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc) authenticate with your cloud provider account
3. (Optional for local development) [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Development

To run the application locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
# This might be `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up --build` depending on the project. #REMOVE_ME_AFTER_EDITING
docker compose up --build
```

## Configuration
#REMOVE_ME_AFTER_EDITING - this section should be removed if there are no configuration values needed. The intro text can probably stay, but the list of configuration values should be updated/removed if there are none.
