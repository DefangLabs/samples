# Defang Samples

Samples to show you how to develop, deploy, and debug cloud applications with Defang.

Browse through the [./samples](./samples) directory, or search and browse in the [docs](https://docs.defang.io/docs/samples).

## Adding Samples

To start working on a new sample, run `. ./scripts/new-sample.sh` from the root of the repository. This will create a new sample directory, with some basic scaffolding to get you started. Look for `#REMOVE_ME_AFTER_EDITING` in your new project to look for things that you should probably be changing/checking per sample. Feel free to remove files, like `compose.dev.yaml` if they aren't necessary for your sample.
