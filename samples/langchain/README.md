# LangChain Text Generation API

This sample project demonstrates how to deploy a LangChain-based text generation API using Flask and Docker. We also demonstrate how to run the application in a Docker container for development and how to manage it using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang) for deploying to production

## Development

For development, we use a virtual environment for dependency management. The application code is provided in the `main.py` file, and dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
