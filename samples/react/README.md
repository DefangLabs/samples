This sample shows how to get a simple React app up and running with Defang. 
It includes Vite and ESLint, which are common build tools for React development. 

## Prerequisites

1. Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)
2. (Optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc) authenticate with your cloud provider account
3. (Optional for local development) [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Development

To run the application locally, you can use the following command (make sure you've got `npm` and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed):

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run it using a Docker container, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)

### Defang Playground

Deploy your application to the Defang Playground by opening up your terminal and typing:
```bash
defang compose up
```

### BYOC (AWS)

If you want to deploy to your own cloud account, you can use Defang BYOC:

1. [Authenticate your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html), and check that you have properly set your environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
2. Run in a terminal that has access to your AWS environment variables:
    ```bash
    defang --provider=aws compose up
    ```
