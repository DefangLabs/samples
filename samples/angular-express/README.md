# Angular + Node.js

This project demonstrates both client-side component rendering and hydration with Angular, as well as server-side rendering with Node.js and Socket.IO for real-time communication. It also includes Docker configurations for easy deployment.

## NOTE

This sample showcases how you could deploy a full-stack application with Angular and Node.js using Defang. The Docker setup ensures the app can be easily built and deployed.

## Essential Setup Files

1. Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/defang-io/defang)
2. (Optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) authenticated with your AWS account
3. (Optional for local development) [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Prerequisites

1. Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/defang-io/defang)
2. (Optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) make sure you have properly authenticated your AWS account
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
4. [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

## Development

For development, we use two local containers, one for the frontend Angular service and one for the backend service in Express. It also uses Caddy as a web server for serving static files. To run the sample locally after cloning the repository, you can run on Docker by doing:

1. `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up`

## A Step-by-Step Guide

1. Open the terminal and type `defang login`
2. Type `defang compose up` in the CLI
3. Your app should be up and running with Defang in minutes!
