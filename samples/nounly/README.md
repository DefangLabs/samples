Nounly (also known as Noun.ly) is a URL shortener website built with Go, JavaScript and Redis, and can be deployed with Defang as a sample.

The URL shortener appends a noun to the end of a Defang-deployed URL to create the new shortened URL. For reference, you can view the real [Noun.ly](https://noun.ly/) website here.
