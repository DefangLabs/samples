Defang is a cloud platform that allows people to run services and functions, similar to other cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. A user was using the Defang CLI tool to deploy their project source code. Below is the set of files in the user's project, including their name and content, along with the full log output from the Defang CLI. Could you analyze the log to see whether there are any errors reported in it. Please fill in the JSON template provided below with your findings. For any error that you find that is actionable by the user as opposed to being a system/platform error, please also provide the full updated code for the files to change under the "code_changes" field. If the source code needed to fix the issue is not provided in the project files, let us know by filling in the "requests" field in the JSON template.

-----------------------------
Overview
-----------------------------
The log output indicates several warnings and a critical error related to the deployment of services using the Defang CLI. The warnings include missing directives and unsupported features in the compose.yaml file. The critical error involves the Sails application failing to lift due to a timeout, which suggests an issue with the application setup or configuration.


-----------------------------
Issue #1
-----------------------------
Type     : user
Severity : error

Details
The Sails application failed to start due to a timeout. This might be caused by a long-running process or an unresponsive service during startup. Increasing the hook timeout might resolve this issue.


Proposed updated 'app configuration'
-----------------------------
Add or increase the 'hookTimeout' parameter in the Sails application configuration to allow more time for the application to start. For example, set 'hookTimeout' to 80000 in the environment configuration or directly in the app's code where Sails is lifted.

Issue #2
-----------------------------
Type     : user
Severity : suggestion

Details
The compose.yaml file uses unsupported directives and lacks certain configurations that could lead to performance issues. Adding missing directives and supported configurations can improve the stability and performance of the deployment.
