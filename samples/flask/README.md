# Flask

[![1-click-deploy](https://defang.io/deploy-with-defang.png)](https://portal.defang.dev/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnew%3Ftemplate_name%3Dsample-flask-template%26template_owner%3DDefangSamples)

This is a basic Flask to-do app that can be deployed with Defang.  Note that alongside your `.py` file, include a `requirements.txt` so that the Dockerfile can install the necessary packages with pip.

This project is intended to provide a basic understanding of how to get started with Flask on Defang. The items are stored in memory and are lost when the server is restarted. **It is not intended for production use**. If you need something production ready, you should use a managed database like Postgres or MySQL.

## Prerequisites

1. Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)
2. (Optional) If you are using [Defang BYOC](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/defang-byoc) authenticate with your cloud provider account
3. (Optional for local development) [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Development

To run the application locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Configuration

For this sample, you will not need to provide [configuration](https://docs.defang.io/docs/concepts/configuration). 

If you wish to provide configuration, see below for an example of setting a configuration for a value named `API_KEY`.

```bash
defang config set API_KEY
```

## Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> Download [Defang CLI](https://github.com/DefangLabs/defang)

### Defang Playground

Deploy your application to the Defang Playground by opening up your terminal and typing:
```bash
defang compose up
```

### BYOC (AWS)

If you want to deploy to your own cloud account, you can use Defang BYOC:

1. [Authenticate your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html), and check that you have properly set your environment variables like `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
2. Run in a terminal that has access to your AWS environment variables:
    ```bash
    defang --provider=aws compose up
    ```
