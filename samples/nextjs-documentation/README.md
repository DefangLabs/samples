This template is a documentation starter project developed using Nextra, designed to streamline the creation of your documentation and quickly build a digital knowledgebase. You can add content easily by simply adding markdown files. This code-free solution requires no adjustments to the basic structure. We have prepared all the essential files for deployment. By spending just a few minutes setting up the environment, as detailed in the prerequisites, and executing the commands in our step-by-step guide, your website will be ready to go live in no time!

## Essential Setup Files
